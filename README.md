**Fake News Detection**
**About**
This project focuses on the detection of fake news using various machine learning models. It compares the performance of multiple classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to determine the most effective model for fake news detection.

The goal is to evaluate each model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the best-performing algorithm for distinguishing between real and fake news.

**Models Used:**
Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest Classifier

Multinomial Naïve Bayes

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
